# Zero-Skip Policy: No Warning/Error/Issue Shall Be Dismissed

Every warning, error, lint violation, test failure, or diagnostic output MUST be investigated
and resolved. This policy applies to all phases of development: coding, building, testing,
linting, ingestion, and code review.

## Rules

1. **No suppression without approval**: Never add ignore rules, `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`,
   `--ignore`, `--no-verify`, an `.agnix.toml` `disabled_rules` entry, or equivalent suppress
   flags without explicit user approval. Each suppression must be justified with a documented
   reason.

2. **Research before deferring**: If a warning or error is encountered, research the root cause.
   Check official documentation, changelog, and issue trackers. Attempt at least one fix.

3. **Escalate to human**: If resolution is unclear after investigation, ask the user via
   AskUserQuestion with: the exact error, what you tried, root cause guess, proposed next steps.
   Do not silently skip or defer.

4. **Track deferred items**: If the user explicitly approves deferring an issue, create a
   GitHub Issue via `gh issue create` with the full context, reproduction steps, and
   references to the diagnostic output.

5. **Green means clean**: A passing gate with suppressed warnings is not "green."
   All diagnostics must be clean, not silenced.

## Local Validation Gate

Before ANY git commit, you MUST run local validation:

1. Run `mise run lint` and verify exit 0
2. If any check fails: research root cause, attempt fix, re-run
3. Only escalate to user via AskUserQuestion after 2 failed fix attempts
4. Do NOT commit until all hk checks pass
5. Do NOT push until `mise run lint` and `mise run test` pass

## Examples of Violations

- Adding an `.agnix.toml` `disabled_rules` entry without documenting why
- Skipping an hk step because the tool isn't installed instead of pinning it in `mise.toml`
- Suppressing a ruff error with `# noqa` instead of fixing the code (the `no_lint_skip`
  step rejects this outright — all suppressions live in the ONE root `pyproject.toml`)
- Ignoring a `kb-build` / `kb-merge` stderr warning because the graph still wrote
- Committing without running `mise run lint`
- Pushing to trigger a check to "see if it passes" instead of validating locally

## Applies To

All tools in this project: ruff, ty, pytest, hk, taplo, rumdl, gitleaks, typos, pkl, agnix,
graphify, and any future additions.

- `verify-before-advancing.md` — the sibling gate: every applicable check
  must be green *with evidence* before advancing to the next task,
  committing, opening/merging a PR, or claiming done.

## Why this rule is eager (never `paths:`-scoped)

It has no `paths:` frontmatter deliberately. Path-scoped rules "trigger when
Claude **reads** files matching the pattern"
(<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory>) — but this rule fires the moment a
warning is about to be *dismissed*, which no glob can predict. In the sibling
dotfiles repo it was scoped to `**/*.py`/`hk.pkl`/workflows until 2026-07-15,
so a session editing only markdown never loaded the rule forbidding skipped
warnings — absent from exactly the sessions it exists to govern. Rules that
guard **judgment** stay eager; only rules whose trigger IS a file (e.g.
`ci-local-parity.md`) are safe to scope. See `md-size-budgets.md`.
