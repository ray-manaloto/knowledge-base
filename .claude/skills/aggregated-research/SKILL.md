Use whenever a question needs an answer from outside this repo: is this a known bug upstream, what do other projects do about this problem, what tooling should we be using, does this feature already exist, why does this dependency behave this way. Use it BEFORE building anything custom, and before reporting that something does not exist — a not-found without a control arm is a lead, not a finding."

# aggregated-research

`$ARGUMENTS` is the research question. With none given, ask for one in a sentence
before running step 0 — a sweep with no question drifts into a survey.

A sweep is worthless if its negatives are unarmed. This skill's whole job is to
make one discipline automatic: **every null result carries a control arm proving
the probe could have returned something else.**

Everything else here is ordering. The acceptance criteria this was built against
are pinned verbatim in `references/acceptance-509.md` — read them if a step here
looks arbitrary.

## Step 0 — the graph, always first

```bash
mise run kb-query -- "<question>"
```

Add `--prose` for a question about DOCUMENTS, `--idf` to rank the returned set.
This step is hook-enforced (`kb_setup.graph_first`): a repo-wide source search is
DENIED until one graph query has run. It also costs zero LLM tokens.

**Arm an empty graph result before believing it.** A miss may be a term-spelling
mismatch against extracted node labels, not an absence. Query a term you KNOW is
in the corpus with the same command shape.

## The sweep — cheapest-refutable-first

Run in this order. The ordering is the substance: #509's worked run went
source-last and produced an artifact and two commits before anyone asked whether
the behaviour was already known upstream. It was, for fourteen months.

### 1. The installed binary

```bash
<tool> --help
```

Then a probe in a **throwaway directory outside this repo**. This is the only step
that can answer questions no document addresses — does it warn, does it read
`.gitignore`, what is its exit code on the empty case.

Version probes go through `mise exec -- <tool> --version`. A bare shim can be a
stale-PATH skew: a lane once reported hk 1.56.0 while the pin said 1.56.1.

### 2. The shipped source at the pinned ref

```bash
gh api "repos/OWNER/REPO/contents/PATH?ref=TAG"
```

`?ref=` goes **inside the path string**. `-f ref=v8.30.1` returns 404.

**Source beats issue tracker.** Issues stay open after their fix ships — graphify

# 959 read as "custom OpenAI endpoints are blocked" long after the feature landed

in 0.8.40. When a secondary artifact says impossible and it matters, read the code.

### 3. Both trackers — issues AND PRs AND discussions

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO --jq '{issues: .has_issues, discussions: .has_discussions}'
gh api -X GET search/issues -f q='repo:OWNER/REPO TERM' --jq '.total_count'
```

The first line is not optional. **A count of zero from a channel that cannot
receive anything is not evidence** — `jdx/hk` has issues DISABLED, so every
`repo:jdx/hk` search is structurally zero.

Never `gh search issues`: it returns `[]` instead of failing, and its control
query with 39 real results also returned `[]` (#507).

### 4. Breadth — delegate to the bundled workflow

```text
/deep-research <question>
```

Claude Code ships this. It fans out across angles, cross-checks, **votes on each
claim, and filters out the claims that did not survive**. Do not hand-roll a
fan-out beside it (`use-tool-builtins.md`). It runs only when invoked, and needs
WebSearch available.

Then **verify its cited claims against primary sources** — it returns a cited
report, not a verified one, and steps 1-2 above are what settles a citation.

Fall back to Firecrawl `developer-index` when WebSearch is unavailable, or when
the question is specifically about a repo's issues and PRs: it returns full issue
bodies and comment threads inline, so the maintainer comment arrives without a
follow-up fetch.

### 5. Synthesis by a strong Claude lane that opens the URLs itself

Research leads are breadth, not truth. A lane that summarises a search-result
snippet has not read the source. Spot-check every factual claim a lane returns —

# 509's breadth lane asserted neither upstream repo was in the corpus while both

manifests exist.

## The control arm — the rule this skill exists for

**Before reporting any negative, run the same command shape against a case you
know succeeds, and paste its non-null output.**

| the null | the arm |
|---|---|
| a grep returns 0 | grep a term you know is present, same shape |
| a tracker search returns 0 | check `has_issues`; then search a term with known hits |
| a graph query returns nothing | query a term you know is ingested |
| an HTTP probe returns 404/301/000 | probe a URL you know returns 200 |
| "no prior art exists" | run the same search for a capability that certainly has prior art |

A redirect, a timeout, a `jq` miss and an empty grep are all *never asked*, not
*answered no*. Say which arm you ran: "bogus input → 404 while known-good → 200,
so the probe discriminates."

**Bounds are the commonest hidden null.** `-maxdepth`, `head -N`, `--limit`, a
time window, a `2>/dev/null` — and a token spelling. A session grepped `lmstudio`
and `lm_studio`, got 0, and reported the feature absent; it is spelled `LM Studio`
with a space, 3 hits, one in the tool's own `--help`.

## The five traps, as checks

Each of these was hit for real. Run the check, do not just know the trap.

1. `gh search issues` → **use `gh api -X GET search/issues`**.
2. Tracker null → **`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO` first**, read `has_issues` /
   `has_discussions`.
3. A citation can contradict what it annotates (#508) → **open the citation**.
4. Version skew → **`mise exec --`**, never the bare shim.
5. A lane's factual claims → **spot-check against this repo** before quoting them.

## Output

A report at `docs/research/reports/<date>-<slug>.md`. Its shape:

- **Answer** — one paragraph, up front.
- **Ranked sources** — primary (source, binary, maintainer statement) separated
  from secondary (issue text, blog, another tool's README).
- **Every null, with its arm** — the command and its non-null control output.
- **Not measured** — an explicit section naming what was NOT checked. #509's most
  useful lines were these.
- **`## GitHub repos touched`** — every repo whose source, README, issues or docs
  were read, one line of reason each (`research-repo-enumeration.md`). This feeds
  `sources/REGISTRY.md`.

**Publish an artifact too when the answer is a decision someone has to make** —
the `eli5-visual` skill owns that, source under `docs/artifacts/`.

**If it was worth fetching, it is worth ingesting.** A code repo →
`mise run kb-manifest-add -- <url>`. Prose → `mise run kb-add -- <url>`. At
minimum append the repo to `sources/REGISTRY.md`.

## When NOT to use this

A one-line factual lookup you can settle with a single `--help`. A question about
this repo's own code — that is `mise run kb-query` alone. A library API signature
— that is `ctx7`.

## Test prompts

The three this skill is scored against, in `references/acceptance-509.md`:

1. *"Is this behaviour a known bug in `<tool>`, and has anyone reported it?"*
2. *"What do other projects do about `<problem>`?"* — the hard one: no primary
   source to anchor on, so it tests whether confirmed can still be separated from
   anecdotal.
3. *"What tools should we be using to research questions like this?"* — the
   self-referential one, so the tool list stays current.
